/**
 * Common interface for the back-end implementation of all sales documents (i.e. <code>Order</code> and
 * <code>Basket</code>). This grouping may not be suitable for all possible back-end/front-end scenarios but saves a lot
 * of implementation effort for the default scenario, where the only back end system is the CRM.<br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Note -</b> There was a design decision to give all back-end interfaces and their implementors a
 * <em>stateless-like</em> behaviour. This means that the back-end objects are not truly stateless because the
 * connection management of the actual used back-end systems cannot support this at all, but the method signatures are
 * similar to stateless objects. This feature forces you to provide a reference to the object the back-end method should
 * work on as a method parameter. This may seem a little bit complicated, but it allows us to migrate to an EJB-Solution
 * with real stateless session beans very easy.
