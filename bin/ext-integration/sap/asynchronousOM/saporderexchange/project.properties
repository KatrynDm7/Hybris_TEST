# As implemented in the default outbound mapping, hybris Order number will be the same as ERP order number.
# Therefore it is required to have:
# - separate number ranges (start values) per hybris installation connected to an SAP backend

# - have the number range of ERP sales documents set up to that provided external number will be accepted.
