
The file js/hmc.js contains most of the hMC's custom javascript code in 
one large concatenated file. The file will be concatenated from scratch
each time the build process is triggered by iterating all *.js files
within js/src folder of the hmc extension as well as the ext/[extension]/js
folder of each extension with hmc module.

If you want to edit content of the hmc.js file then you will have 
to write or edit a *.js file in the [extension]/hmc/jsp/ext/[extension]/js
folder of your extension. It will be copied to the hmc extension and used
automatically at build process.
