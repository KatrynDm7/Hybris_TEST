
The file css/hmc.css contains most of the hMC's custom css code in 
one large concatenated file. The file will be concatenated from scratch
each time the build process is triggered by iterating all *.css files
within css/src folder of the hmc extension as well as the ext/[extension]/css
folder of each extension with hmc module.

If you want to edit content of the hmc.css file then you will have 
to write or edit a *.css file in the [extension]/hmc/jsp/ext/[extension]/css
folder of your extension. It will be copied to the hmc extension and used
automatically at build process.
