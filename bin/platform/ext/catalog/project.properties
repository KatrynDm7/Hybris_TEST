#Allows to define how synchronization process translates a collection of references in case that not all
#source references can be translated. 
#Set this property to true if you want to translate collections partially. It means if translation of
#particular reference fails, then this particular reference will be skipped but translation of collection
#will be continued. Parent item will be marked as pending.
#Set this property to false if you don't want to translate collections partially. It means if translation
#of any reference fails, then translation of whole collection will be stopped and target collection will
#remain unchanged or empty in case of new parent item.
