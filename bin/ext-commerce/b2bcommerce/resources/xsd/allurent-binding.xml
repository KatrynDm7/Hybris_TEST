<!-- The XML Schema Allurent generates to validate XML data model representations 
	requires a custom binding definition in order to be passed through JAXB's 
	XJC tool. The issue stems from the implicit inheritance in the data model 
	that a Sku has all properties that a Product specifies. The XML Schema representation 
	of this causes the following error when executing XJC (based on version jaxb-ri-20091104): 
	> xjc.bat -p com.allurent.model.generated modeltypes.xsd parsing a schema... 
	compiling a schema... [ERROR] Two declarations cause a collision in the ObjectFactory 
	class. line 684 of file:/modeltypes.xsd [ERROR] (Related to above error) 
	This is the other declaration. line 245 of file:/modeltypes.xsd Failed to 
	produce code. This name collision can be avoided through the use of the following 
	custom binding definition passed to XJC. -->
