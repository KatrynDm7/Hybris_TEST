hybris [y]Destiny 2 Red;hy0001_compactred;hybris [y]Destiny 2 Red;"<p>The hybris [y]Destiny 2 is a nod in the direction of classic high end 35mm compact cameras and fills the gap between digital compact cameras and compact system cameras. Every feature on the [y]Destiny 2 is designed for better image quality, from the extra bright f1.8 lens to the Dual Image Stabiliser, RAW shooting and full manual control. The tough lacquer finished body oozes quality and is small enough to fit in your pocket.</p>
<h3>e[y]e Lens</h3>
<p>The top quality 4x zoom lens on the [y]Destiny 2 covers the equivalent of 28-112mm, and so is ideal for both wide angle and telephoto shooting. Its trump card though is the f1.8-2.5 extra wide aperture. When combined with the extra sensitive CCD sensor that has max ISO 6400 sensitivity, you can successfully obtain great images where popular wisdom would normally tell you to stop shooting because it’s just too dark. This task is further aided by the image stabiliser described below.</p>
<h3>Dual Image Stabiliser</h3>
<p>The [y]Destiny 2 employs a dual image stabilisation system that uses sensor shift technology to give you an extra two exposure stops when shooting in low light or snapping fast moving action.</p>
<h3>Emphasis on Image Quality</h3>
<p>The [y]Destiny 2 keeps the focus firmly on image quality right from lens to memory card. Its 10 megapixel image sensor is a large 1/1.63” is designed for lower noise and the TruePic V image processor assists in the same aim. As the [y]Destiny 2 has an option to shoot in RAW, you can also side-step any image degradation from JPEG compression.</p>
<h3>3-inch OLED Monitor</h3>
<p>The hybris [y]Destiny 2’s monitor uses the emerging technology of OLED, or “Organic Light Emitting Diodes”. Basically its big difference from a traditional LCD display is that the pixels themselves are light sources and so the display doesn’t have to be lit from behind. The difference is astonishing with far greater contrast and punchiness, wider viewing angle and better colour rendition. The high resolution 610,000 pixels gives you an extra sharp view of your images.</p>
<h3>Manual Control</h3>
<p>The manual control functions on the [y]Destiny 2 have lens-ring adjustment - everything from shutter and aperture to art filters and background blur for ease of use. Has P/A/S/M settings on its control dial for instant access. For those moments when you don’t have time for manual control, the camera also has Intelligent Auto and Live Guide to help first time users.</p>
<h3>Expandability</h3>
<p>Also features an accessory port for electronic viewfinder, flash or microphone adapter, making the [y]Destiny 2 2 a versatile tool.</p>";229;01a;1;01/09/2012;01/09/2013;pieces;Hats
hybris [y]Mini 3 Red;hy0004_ultracompactred;hybris [y]Mini 3 Red;"<p>Amazing things come in this small package. The hybris [y]Mini 3 has it all, from a stunningly thin 3/4"" body to advanced technologies that make it easy to shoot gorgeous photos and videos.

<p>Sometimes a flash can wash out the scene, making it hard to capture the mood of the moment. For low-light environments, the back-illuminated e[y]ePlus CMOS sensor delivers stunning performance and increases sensitivity by 2x to reduce noise. Shots around the campfire never looked better.</p>
<p>Capture decisive moments—like midair dives into the pool—with the ability to shoot up to ten images in one second at full 10.2 megapixel resolution. And by employing a mechanical shutter, distortion is reduced when continuously shooting moving subjects.
