 ;1209761;;8X25 IS;8X25 IS;Just 12 cm wide and weighing only 490g. the new 8x25 IS binoculars are the most compact and lightweight IS binoculars Canon has ever developed.<br/><br/>- Compact, lightweight design<br/>- Tilt Mechanism Image Stabiliser<br/>- 8x magnification power<br/>- Rounded shape<br/>- Field flattener lens<br/>- Simple and convenient to use<br/>- Battery allows 6 hours of continuous operation<br/>- Centrally mounted controls.<br/><br/>Canon's smallest and lightest IS Binoculars<br/><br/>The new IS binoculars have an appealing rounded shaped design for more comfortable handling. They owe their small size, low weight and superb image-stabilising ability to the latest in Image Stabilisation technology: the Tilt Mechanism. This mechanism keeps your subject steady by correcting movements, such as hand shake. Battery power is minimised because the IS optics only uses power when the IS button is pressed. Like the focusing knob, this button is centrally located on the binoculars, easily reachable by both left and right handed users. As a further refinement, the tilt-system Image Stabiliser of the 8x25 IS suppresses chromatic aberrations and reduces colour ‘smearing’ in order to keep your image clear. Being environmentally conscious Canon have used lead-free glass in the new IS binoculars.

Clear picture quality can be enough resolution for printing up to poster size. A robust mounted image processor allows for rich gradation, fast and high quality picture processing.<br/><br/><b>dual image stabilisation (OIS + DIS)</b><br/>Blurry images can be caused by many factors, such as hand shaking, zooming or insufficient light. Dual Image Stabilisation eliminates the blur caused by camera shake and delivers clear, crisp images every time-even under difficult lighting situations. Integrating the best lens shifting mechanisms of Optical Image Stabilisation (OIS) with the sophisticated algorithms of Digital Image Stabilisation (DIS), Dual Image Stabilisation - another superior SAMSUNG innovation - corrects even the tiniest of shakes.<br/><br/><b>smart auto</b><br/>Taking the perfect photo shouldn't be left just to the professionals. With SAMSUNG's innovative Smart Auto technology, your photos are guaranteed to come out perfect every time.<br/>- Automatically analyses the shooting situations.<br/>- Selects from one of the 11 optimised settings from portraits to landscapes.<br/>- Takes the best photo possible no matter what the conditions are.<br/><br/><b>perfect portrait system</b><br/>With our unique Perfect Portrait system imperfect photos are a thing of the past.

And with different level settings, you can control the amount of retouching that takes place - it's that simple! Plus, the ultra-intelligent Smile and Blink detection technologies will never let you ruin another picture-perfect moment again by detecting when the subjects' eyes are open and their smiles are at their peak.<br/><br/><b>frame guide</b><br/>Imagine being able to compose a photo even before it's shot. The world's first Frame Guide feature on the PL60 has turned that into reality. The Frame Guide feature allows you easily set up the composition of the shot so it can be used as a guide for the photographer. Simply hand off the camera and you'll never have to be missing from another photo. Now your vacation pictures will come out exactly the way you envisioned them.<br/><br/><b>5x optical zoom lens</b><br/>The 5x zoom will let you get close to the action without letting the bulkiness of the camera get in the way.

Its one fluorite lens and two UD lenses completely eliminate secondary spectrum. It offers super high image quality with both resolution and contrast higher than ever before. And the image stabilizer that equals about 2 shutter speed steps maximizes the performance of the lens under all photography conditions. Its autofocusing is the fastest in the world (when used with an EOS-3), thanks to a ring USM and improved drive algorithm. Closest focusing distance has been reduced to 2.5m, while operatibility has been substantially improved by full time mechanical manual focus, improved focus preset, and the introduction of an AF Stop function. The lens's super light design includes a magnesium alloy lens barrel and it offers good dust-proof and moisture-proof performance even under harsh conditions. It comes with a removable tripod.
